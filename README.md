Simulated Industrial Process Monitoring System

This project simulates a backend system for monitoring industrial processes using publicly available weather data as a proxy. It demonstrates key backend development skills relevant to various industries, including:

    API interaction
    Data processing
    Database management
    Asynchronous task handling

Project Setup

    Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install flask requests psycopg2 redis RQ-Py  # Adjust dependencies based on your implementation

    Create a .env file (store sensitive information outside of version control):

OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_api_key

    Configure environment variables:

Bash

export FLASK_APP=app.py  # Replace with your main application file
export FLASK_ENV=development  # Adjust for production environment

    Run the application:

Bash

flask run

Functionality

The project provides the following functionalities:

    Fetching weather data: Retrieves real-time weather data for multiple simulated industrial locations using the OpenWeatherMap API.
    Data processing: Extracts relevant weather data points (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) from the API response and performs any necessary cleaning or transformation.
    Database storage: Stores the processed weather data in a PostgreSQL database with a schema designed for efficient time-series data storage.
    RESTful APIs:
        /api/v1/current/<location_name>: Retrieves the latest weather data for a specific location.
        /api/v1/historical/<location_name>: Retrieves historical weather data for a specific location within a given time range (requires additional implementation details).

Note: Implementing the historical data retrieval endpoint requires specifying a date range in the API request and storing historical data in the database.
Asynchronous Data Fetching (Optional)

For a more realistic simulation of continuous monitoring, you can implement asynchronous tasks to periodically fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This is achieved by using a message queue like Redis Queue or a task queue like RQ. The main application can enqueue a task to fetch data at regular intervals, ensuring data updates without blocking the main application thread.

Note: Implementing asynchronous data fetching requires additional library installations and configuration.
Error Handling and Logging

The project should implement robust error handling to gracefully handle API errors or database connection issues. Logging should be used to track application activity and errors for debugging and monitoring purposes.

Further Enhancements:

    Implement unit tests for critical functions.
    Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku) for wider accessibility.
    Explore containerization using Docker for easier deployment and scalability.

Remember to replace your_api_key with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key before running the project.
